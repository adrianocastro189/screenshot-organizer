# Screenshot Organizer

An application to organize World of Warcraft screenshots based on their 
timestamps.

**Note:** This is an experimental project and it's expected to have bugs and
limitations.

## Motivation

World of Warcraft screenshots are saved in the game's folder with a 
timestamp that's not well sorted by OS file managers due to the way the
date is formated: month, day and year. So playing the game for a long time
will likely result in a folder full of screenshots that are sorted first by
month, then by day, and then by year, which doesn't make much sense, as
they should be sorted by year, month, and day.

This application aims to solve this problem by organizing the screenshots
into folders based on their timestamps, so players can easily find the
screenshots they want to share or keep with a better sense of timeline.
